## Description
This application is designed to allow the user to create a team list based on a list of employees. Choices include Manager, Engineer and Intern.  For each team member the user can input the respective response that may include name, id, office number, email, GitHub or School. Once they select the team member and answer the associated questions then the data that is imputed is pushed up in an HTML format to be rendered by the browser. I used several .js and .html files for creating my objects, test pages for testing an app.js for outputting data. The output data is sent to the final HTML file called team.html and styled with CSS. 
I experienced challenges with several pieces of this assignment. Creating the Employee class and constructors to figure out how the data was going to be returned was challenging. Also, creating the switch, case function and the exit application function in app.js took some time to understand.

## Initialization:
When using the app you will need to run `node app.js` to initiate.

## Test:
Run `npm run test` to initialize the testing stage.
